    "# Introduction to the Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The influence of the prestige of a university on career success is a significant area of research, especially in fields like engineering where educational pedigree may impact job opportunities and earnings potential. The discussion typically revolves around whether the advantages of attending a top-tier university, such as enhanced learning environments, better networking opportunities, and elevated prestige, translate into tangible career benefits like higher salaries, job satisfaction, and overall career advancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prior Research and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "An article provided by NBC News notes significant differences in starting salaries among graduates from universities of varying prestige. For instance, graduates from the University of Southern California have a notable starting salary advantage over those from lesser-known institutions and that graduates from Yale have an average starting salary of /$68,300/, significantly higher than the /$32,000/ starting salary for graduates from Mississippi Valley State University. [(^1)](#cite_note-1) This highlights the economic benefit of attending more prestigious universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has provided mixed insights into the relationship between university ranking and career success. A study by Dale and Krueger (2014) found that for most students, the selectivity of the college they attend does not affect their earnings significantly after controlling for the competitiveness of the student. However, for subgroups such as students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the prestige of the institution did have a positive impact on earnings potential. [(^2)](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Further compounding this view, research from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) suggests that college quality, as measured by resources and educational conditions, does correlate with higher earnings post-graduation. [(^3)](#cite_note-3) This correlation persists even when accounting for student backgrounds and labor market conditions, indicating that the institution's characteristics independently contribute to the career outcomes of its graduates​​.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Relevance to Current Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This previous work sets a foundational understanding that while the reputation of an educational institution may not universally guarantee better job prospects or earnings, it does provide certain groups with measurable advantages. The current project can build on these findings by more specifically analyzing how these outcomes vary among engineering graduates, where the impact of a university's rank might be more pronounced due to the technical and often competitive nature of the field.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that getting a degree from a top-20 engineering university in the United States will not improve an individual's career success beyond that of a recipient of the top 100 engineering schools. This is because the quality of education is similar at the top 100 schools, and other factors such as connections, creativity, and personality will have a stronger impact on career success than where people received their undergraduate degree."
